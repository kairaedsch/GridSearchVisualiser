# Grid Search Visualiser
A online algorithm visualiser for pathfinding algorithms.

The tool was created for my bachelor thesis "Jump Point Search on Directed Grids" at the University of Passau.

## How to use
The tool can be used at [jps.mysticwind.de](https://jps.mysticwind.de/).

## Features

### üìà Supported Grids
Two grid modes are supported with additional options:

| Grid Mode Blockwise | Grid Mode Edgewise |
| ------------------- | - |
| <img src="images/grid-blockwise.png"/> | <img src="images/grid-edgewise.png"/> |
| In this mode, each node can be blocked. | In this mode, each edge can be blocked per direction. |
| <img src="images/grid-blockwise-cross-corners.png"/> | <img src="images/grid-edgewise-detail.png"/> |
| **+ option** crossing corners allowed. | Each blue object blocks a direction. |
| <img src="images/grid-blockwise-cardinal-only.png"/> | |
| **+ option** cardinal paths only. | |

### ü§ñ Supported Algorithms
| Algorithm                | Description |
| ------------------------ | - |
| **Dijkstra**             | The Dijkstra PathÔ¨Ånding Algorithm |
| **A\***                  | The A* PathÔ¨Ånding Algorithm |
| **DJPS**                 | The Directed Jump Point Search Algorithm (alternative Version) |
| **DJPS Lookup**          | The Directed Jump Point Search Lookup Algorithm using pre-calculated lookup data |
| **DJPS Pre-Calculation** | The Directed Jump Point Search Pre-Calculation Algorithm using backwards pre-calculation |

### üìê Supported Heuristics
| Heuristics    | Description |
| ------------- | - |
| **Chebyshev** | The Chebyshev distance as heuristic. This distance is calculated by the moves a chess king would have to make. |
| **Euclidean** | The Euclidean distance as heuristic. This distance is calculated as the crow Ô¨Çies. |
| **Octile**    | The octile distance as heuristic. This distance is calculated by the length of the octile path. |
| **Manhattan** | The Manhattan distance as heuristic. This distance is calculated by summing the diÔ¨Äerence of the x and the y coordinates.  |
